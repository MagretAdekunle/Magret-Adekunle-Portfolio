    bio: "Hello! I'm Magret Adekunle. I'm a Graduate Student of The University of Texas at Austin. I studied Computer Science, Mathatics, and African & African Diaspora Studies at The Univerity of Texas at Austin. I enjoy taking photo on my films cameras and eating out, and I believe artificial intelligence will inevitably rule us all one day.",
    bio2:"My aim is to give back to those who have been marginalized, those who lack the resources needed to attain an adequate education, and to enhance our everyday life. Check out some of my work in the Portfolio section. You should hire me!",
    myresearch1: "Correspondingly, my Senior Seminar course helped me to explore the intersectionality of technology and health sciences within the context of the health and well-being of Black communities. In my research, I discovered that AI-based tools assessing crime are twice as likely to misclassify Black individuals as being at a higher risk of engaging in criminal activity compared to their White counterparts.",
    myresearch2: "These issues arise from algorithms not understanding the historical and political factors that cause such disadvantage and disparity for marginalized populations who are subjected to these tools.",
    myresearch3: "I firmly believe that addressing these negative aspects of AI is crucial, not to discredit the advancements made by AI, but rather to identify and improve any adverse effects. As scientists, we can work towards finding effective solutions and ensuring that AI continues to contribute positively to our society.",
